    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>

    <h2>Tracking, reporting, and alerting Portland communties since 2018</h2>
    <p>
        We allow individuals to report ICE raids in their communities and alert those who have signed up. If a raid is reported, a text message will immediately be sent out to all registered members. <br /><br />
        Because our raid reports are provided by eye witnesses, we unfortunately cannot guarantee the validity of all reported sightings.<br /><br />
        Many features of our project were inspired by Redad Alertas. Learn more <a href="http://redadalertas.com">here</a>.
